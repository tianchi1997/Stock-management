# Charlotte

## Description

Charlotte is a stock management web program running on Ruby on Rails intended for use with medical stock items, that are a mix of perishable and non-perishable items.
This product has been designed to be used on both PC's and tablets with an on-screen numberpad for stocktaking.

## What does it do?

Charlotte has the following capabilities:
* Item Expiry
    * A stock item can be set to expire.
    * When an item passes expiry date, it will automatically be removed from the available amount in the stock check.
    * The expired amounts still remain in the total amount that are shown beside the available amount inside the parentheses.
* Stock Checking
    * The quantity of each items in locations can be accessed by simply seleting a location in the 'Locations' page.
    * If a user need to know where a stock item is located the quantity of each stock item can be accessed by selecting a stock item in the 'Stock Items' page.
    * Each item can be clicked to access the item's audit page detailed below.
* Stock Taking
    * Users with appropriate permissions can perform a stocktake on the selected location.
    * This can be done through keyboard and mouse input or by touchscreen input using the numberpad.
    * Items that can expire will have a date-picker 
* Stock Reporting
    * Users with appropriate permissions can generate a report page that lists all the items and the amount required for the current location and all the sublocations within.
    * Users can expand the report to also generate a summary of each sublocation by selecting the 'Display Sub-Locations' option.
    * An order report can be generated by selecting the 'Order Report' option. This will filter out any items that are stocked to or above the required amount.
    * The expiry date can be displayed for items that allow it by selecting the 'Display Expiry Dates' option.
    * An order report from any location can be downloaded as a CVS file to be used outside the program.
* Auditing
    * When performing a stocktake, the time of change, the user and the amount will be recorded any time a change is made.
